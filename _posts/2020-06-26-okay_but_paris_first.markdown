## Friends Unforgotten

  My current chapter in my story of becoming a professional developer got a huge boost today.  I graduated from Flatiron School! Wow... what an amazing experience, boy let me tell ya. It was exciting, frustrating, full blown mental in parts, but it was way worth every minute. I got to do things in a short amount of time, that other people take a year or more to accomplish. I met awesome people along the way and even gained a good friend in the process.  I will miss this time as it was the only thing I had to worry about, get up, eat and crunch code until bed time.  While that was nice, it's time to turn the page and start my next chapter.
	
	

## Carry on My Wayward son

Now that I have my formal education freshly behind me, I'm ready to put it to good use. Enter professionalism. The training wheels are off and now and time has come, to prove to the world that I am ready to do this professionally, boy that has a nice ring to it doesn't it? I thought so anyway. My long term goal, like long-term I mean over 15 years from now, I want to be a database architect. The goals I want to achieve require I do this. Hear me now, I will have it done 15 years from now, bet on it.


## Come True

Here it is the next chapter laid out in front of me. Do I take a tepid step or do I just jump right in?  Well, that's an interesting question now isn't it? Both have merit and both have their own drawbacks, so which path is best for me? To answer this I have to ask myself do I stop my continued education, momentarily, to rigorously search for a position with the current arsenal of skills I have, or, do I hammer down on my continued education and passively look for a position? In my opinion continued education and passively looking for a job is a wise course of action as not only are you still applying for positions but you are now adding more to your skills list and also you show the willingness and ability to learn new things. That is super valuable in itself. 

Writing this I am starting to realize that my dream, an actual dream of mine, was coming true. It is one of the most surreal moments in my life, and Im ready to embrace the unknown and take things in stride, all in the name of bettering my knowledge for my future.

## Conclusion

This is definitely not the last chapter in this story not by a long shot. Stay tuned as more will be added to my blog as the journey continues.

### Until next time my fellow codersâ€¦
### Happy Coding!! Remember #Keep Calm and Code On!!
