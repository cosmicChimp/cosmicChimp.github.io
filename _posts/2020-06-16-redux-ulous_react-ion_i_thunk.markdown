## Recap

...And just like that! The final project for the Fullstack Web Engineering course at Flatiron School is done!  The last thing we touched on was using Vanilla JS w/ a Rails API to build an SPA. Learning ES6 JavaScript was one of the most valuable things I could have learned before doing this project, we'll get to it in a second, as it really made learning REACT and REDUX w/ THUNK a lot easier as it uses mainly ES6 to function, well besides the React framework itself. On we go....!

## React to Redux with Thunk

The idea behind this project was to showcase basically everything we learned up until now culminating into one application using the React framework with the React-Redux and Redux library to manage state, on top of that you had to build out your own Rails API to store info, and fetch using the Thunk library as React and Redux inherently don't support asynchronous fetching directly through React.  So your goal here is to update the Redux store using asynchronous fetching and rendering that inforamtion from the Redux store into the React state, so the props can be passed to all the child components...whew when you spell it out it sounds a lot easier than it was, and, like I stated above would have been a whole lot harder without the knowledge of ES6, if you don't use ES6 JS you have to do twice the work to get the state and sequentially the store and ultimately the backend database updated. LEARN ES6!!

## Hatched an Idea

As you can tell through my projects I base a lot of my ideas on my IRL circumstances, much like my other ones this I based it on a journal or record to keep track of the results of chicken egg incubation. Myself had just recently picked up chicken farming, well chicken breeding anyway, as I've always had chickens for eggs and such but never had I tried breeding, so I gave it a shot. I found it to be really enjoyful breeding chickens and I wanted to keep track of the differing settings to gain a optimal hatch rate. I thought to myself...  that I can just make one! Thus, it was concieved, hey you know? If this program adventure, goodness forbids, ends in a failure at least I have chickens to fall back on!  

## Conclusion

My last project at Flatiron is now complete, I will miss the educational expierence I had the pleasure of being a part of. These past 6 months have proved to be very difficult but very, very rewarding as that I will have a special tool that not a lot of people get the chance to experience for themselves...

#### ...I can code programs and that is way flippin' cool.

##### Until next time my fellow codersâ€¦

##### Happy Coding!! Remember #Keep Calm and Code On!!
