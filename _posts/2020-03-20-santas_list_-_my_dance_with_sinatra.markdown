## Recap

Before we get to my next step along this amazing journey on my path to Fullstack Development, let's recap what has happened leading up to this current project.
  I had learned how to use and incorporate Ruby OOP into a working app and I realized what it was used for as it's integrel to programming rail based web applications. Having this knowledge gave me a better understanding on how thesse applications work and what gets them to work. So now we move on to an app used to create a full-scale web application that uses a server database to store user input information!!
	
## MVC and CRUD

For this project we needed to create an app that would store and collect informaton from server database that a user could use to **Create**, add something new to a database. **Read**, collect the information inputted into the DB. **Update**, update the information inputted to the DB. Finally, **Delete**, deleting the record from the DB. These are called CRUD methods. We use these to create routes that send information to and from the server database in the url that is specific to the current user and renders it either to the User's browser, **READ**, or for the user to write, **CREATE**, to the server. We had to build these route commands into our program using the MVC file structure. MVC stands for Models, Views, and Controllers. Models help to create the back-end server database that stores the User input information. Views are used to create the front-end view (the web page) that user sees and where the info, from the DB, for the current user is displayed. Controllers are used to shuttle commands back and forth from User to Server using said CRUD methods. Put altogether and you get a fully functional web application!!

## Something Inspired 

Since we were building a web application where th subject of which needs to mean something to you personally, like a collection of sorts that can be recored and updated. I wanted to do something I could later build on, seeing as though its supposed to be close to the heart, I figured I could add to it and upgrade thru my career. I went with creating an online app that could store Kids' wishes for Santa throughout the year that parents could get access to all year and collect gifts as they go as to not make the Holiday season that much more stressful. 

We as parents stress around the Holiday season racking our brains trying to figure out what our kids want to make them as happy as possible, because lets face it no parent wants to see thier kid upset no matter how material or trivial it may seem. 

I decided that how cool would it be if the kid everytime they thought of something (I know it can be a lot, lol) they just enter it into the website and around the Holidays the parents can access it and select the appropriate one for their kids. You can even use it for other gift bearing occasions, birthdays, baby-showers, weddings, etc..! 
It's a wishlist for all ages and people alike! It's a great way to keep track of any and every Idea you may have!!

## Conclusion

I loved doing this project as I got to not only create a full scale web app but one that means a lot to me. I loved the simplicity of ActiveRecord migrations and associations and the more I code the easier it comes to me and I'm hoping my understanding of Sinatra, ActiveRecord, MVC and CRUD will help the transition to Rails that much more exciting!!

Until next time my fellow coders...

### Happy Coding!!
