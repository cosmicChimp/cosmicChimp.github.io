## Recap
Here we are again 4 months down and 3 porfolio projects. This has just been amazing... I never thought that in 4 short months, I would learn any of what I know now, First data gems, that was cool, then came Sinatra, that was...interesting to say the least, and now here we are at Ruby on Rails...


## The Beauty of Rails

Unlike Sinatra where you have to maunally route the CRUD actions, when I mean manually, you had to explicitly tell the browser what to do and when, RUBY ON RAILS has so much "Magic" that it sometimes leaves you baffled on the intuitivness of Rails when calling on RESTful routes it under the hood does exactly what you do in Sinatra but with out all the maunal labor....What??....beautiful!!! The form helpers alone are amazing in themselves for when you want to create, edit and update a record you only use one method of helper forms for both actions...WHAT???.... ok, I'm done, sorry I just cant believe how amazing and "magical" RoR really is. Here we go on JavaScript next!!

## An idea....?

When I started thinking of and idea to do for a full scale web application, I did not realize how difficult it was to "simply" come up with an idea, HOOOOOOOOLLLLLYY COW! It took me a solid 8 hours just to come up with an idea!! Well I finally settled on something that I took from my past experience and I think it could be something huge, without going into too much detail, the app is designed to help you find local independent contractors to help facilitate deliveries for companies that are too busy to keep up with demand. I cant tell you how many breathless hours I spent trying to find coverage for a particular route that was already pushing its time windows, if I had somthing like this then it would've saved all those years I lost because of stress.

Its amazing what ideas you can come up with when you have a semi traumatic experience that you can help solve for someone else.

## Conclusion

I had a bunch of fun with this module Ruby on Rails, I cant wait to keep going and learn more great stuff!!
Next in line is JavaScript!! From what I understand, everything that I just got used to is thrown out, JS is whole different animal and I cant wait to dive in!!

Until next time my fellow codersâ€¦

Happy Coding!!
Remember #Keep Calm and Code On!!
