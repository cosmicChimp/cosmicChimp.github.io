## Recap

  The last time you were here I talked about why I got started in programming and what it meant to me and how I was excited to be doing this. As we moved along in our curriculum through Ruby Object Oriented Programming(OOP), I hit major highs and, don't be fooled, major lows. Programming kind of does that to you, you know, you hit a stride and have huge confidance in yourself and then... Wham!!... that pretty little cliff you were so high on before, has crumbled to the water below, only to come to wondering if you can still see straight . Those lows can come on quick and heavy however, if there is one thing I learned and continue to learn is to just press forward, trust in yourself to slog through the mud to get back to even ground, it will happen I promise.
	
## The Perfect Subject
	
Ok so now that I've caught you up a little bit, we have now arrived at my first portfolio project, the CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project.  The objective of this project was to demonstrate our knowledge of object-oriented programming to build methods that would return information from the web through an interactive CLI. In doing so we had to demonstrate our ability to properly scrape a web page, if the one you are looking at does not have an API(most smaller ones don't).

Now that I know what requirements I need to complete my project the next step is to pick a subject.  Subject....hmm seems easy right? Well it can tough, your idea needs to have enough depth to provide enough information to the user to make the CLI app worthwhile. As an example think of a web page itself, it has different links and paths to different infomation that the user can easily access. Your app needs to be basically the same, have a page where the user selects an option and then takes them to another page with more and different information and so on.

## The Process

The subject I chose for my project was our solar system. The solar system has a bunch of different things inside of it like the planets, our Sun and The Moon, etc. So this subject in of itself is dynamic.  I decided that I wanted the user to be able to choose an option on the start screen (call method) to either "Start" or "Exit" the program.
On the second screen is where they are promted to enter a number corresponding to the planet they wanted to see. Then on the 3rd level they are presented with the information about the planets.

The goal in this process is to type as little code as possible, which meant a lot of refactoring. That's where scraping comes in to play. The point of scraping is to have your application communicate with a web page to show the data you want in your app without it all being hardcoded. Using OOP with scraping is how I was able to provide information to each individule planet without having 1000 lines of code. Study those scraping techniques as well as the require_relative method. It will make your life a lot easier.

## Conclusion

The beauty of OOP is something that is not acknowledged as much because it can be hard to learn. I'm no master at Ruby OOP, I'll be the first to say, however it is a beautiful language and can be pretty useful, especially if your looking to develop gems for other programmers to use.
So, all-in-all I was happy and proud of how I did in this language and I can not wait to learn whatever else is on its way to greet me!!

### Until next time...Happy Coding!!!
