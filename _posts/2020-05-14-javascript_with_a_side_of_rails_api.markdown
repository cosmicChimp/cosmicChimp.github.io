## Recap

Wow... Done with Vanilla JS and Rails API project. I cannot believe that I am here now. Ruby groundworks, Sinatra base routing, Ruby on Rails RESTful routing, and now JS w/ Rails API. I only have 1 short month left on my journey to Fullstack Engineering at the Flatiron School. Up next.... React JS w/ Redux! Let's do this.

## How JavaScript

For this project we had to make a single page application(SPA) in the web browser using a Rails API which you had create yourself. Then we had to build the front end using AJAX calls to the database and render the JSON data to the webpage using DOM manipulation. One thing about Vanilla JS is that you have to write out EVERYTHING, its not so bad really, being able to build an under-the-hood project is definitely going to help when going onto the next stages of JS using React and Redux. Tedious, yes, but very rewarding as you can literally see your wbepage come alive thru functions.

## Idea Point

My SPA surrounds the idea of a fantasy DnD squad generator. Im not much one for DnD (i like the concept) but it has so much information that you could spend countless hours researching and creating all sorts of different characters that fill the realm of fantasy. Basically you go on fill out a form for a new character and add it to any leaders squad. Simple, I know, at first, but this could really develop and that always bodes well for future products.

## Conclusion

I didn't have much to update on this entry only because Vanilla JS only covers so much. However whats coming next is sure to be exciting and challenging. That's right here we come REACT and REDUX!!

Until next time my fellow codersâ€¦

Happy Coding!! Remember #Keep Calm and Code On!!
