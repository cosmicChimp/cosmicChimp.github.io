## A Brief History

I was born and raised in Denver, CO by my Mother Kelly and Father Chris. I married my lovely wife Liz whom I met in middle school and have been best friends for years before finally making the leap in the fall of 2013. We have two wonderful boys Braeden, who is 5 years old and Desmond, who is 2 years old. Our family lives in the foothills along the divide near Castle Rock, which is located about 30 miles south of Denver.

 The events that lead me to my path of coding, started around a couple years after I was born. My dad was working for a cross-country tech firm that specalized in generating digital profiles for companies looking to make the switch from pencil and paper business dealings to online accessabilty. It was then that my dad started to code programs for this company that would allow such info to be proscessed digitally. My father then built his whole life upon this idea that coding is the way of the future and it could only expand from there. Little did he know JavaScript would be born just the next year, which he then, of course added to his knowledge because he learned the new language as it came out. So in other words he has been programming since the birth of mulit-language programming.
 
##  Wayward Journey...
 
 As my brother and I grew older and started to understand that computer programs are the way to go and offer endless possiblities(as far as entertainment goes, not quite data storage yet) we were hooked.  With my brother easily being the smarter one than me, started to poke around the backend system functions, and I was just still occupied with the dazzling lights the monitor displayed. That was when I decided that computers and tech was not going to be my thing, because  my brother instantly took to the intricacies of technology like my dad did in his early career and I couldn't get past the front screen.
 
 I convinced myself that I was not cut out for this tech stuff and I was way better and more interested in sports.  I played football for 10 years from pop-warner through my Sophomore year in high school. Then I played rugby my last 2 years. Funny though... even through all the years of playing sports I always immursed myself into the anayltics of it all and could see patterns in the data that really made sense and helped better my performance. After an injury that occured in my last year in high school, I realized then that I wasn't going to be able to do sports either!!  So, in the decade after those events, I worked in the customer service industry(4 years restaurant, 6 years as a Logisitics Supervisor). I always gravitated to the more complex roles of any company I worked for and found peace in locating issues and fixing them,  i.e my Logistics role.  After years of spinning my tires for a basically deadend job, I realized that I enjoyed finding issues and designing solutions that stayed working after first implementation.
 
## ...Realized
 
 I was exploring my options for switching my career when I came across a Forbes article about the rise of computer programming and engineering, when it clicked! I have never even attempted to program or code for that matter! I mean my dad is now a systems engineer and my brother is now the lead IT tech for a multi-million dollar company, so coding must a be a blood thing right? To test this theory out I started messing around with a few program language applications and I found that I absolutely love this coding thing, it just makes sense!! What is it if not one big puzzle to dissect and return a beautiful product? That was just 3 months ago... 
 
**To any prospective student let me say this:**  Don't be afraid to make the leap into the unknown. I am just a few weeks into my schooling for program engineering and I have never been happier and sure about where I am in this world (aside from marriage and kids, etc... lol).  As I said before I was convinced that I was not cut out for this life but the small calling in the back of my head always lead me down a path that would evenutally lead me to quitting my comfy and consistant job to explore the unkown. There will be compromises, for sure, the sacrifices my family and I had to make, to ensure that I could follow this path, is imeasurable and for that I am ever grateful. However, it has been so rewarding and I feel accomplished.  I now know I can make a global impact just by coding and that feels...awesome. 


**To my fellow students:** Keep Calm and Code On. Don't give up! 


***HAPPY CODING!!***
